# Option Strategy Back Tester

In this repository, I develop a prototype end-to-end back tester for option trading.

First a web crawler is build to extract option chain from Nasdaq.com daily.

Then option chains are stored in a relational sql database.

The final back tester is designed to test short straddle, short strangle, as well as iron condor
for four ticker, namely 'NVDA','FB','AAPL','BABA'. The model in the back tester provides average 
return and risk-adjusted return given expiry date and trading period.

A more sophisticated back tester system and detail documentation is still underway...
